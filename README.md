- Hi, Iâ€™m Doug.
- Iâ€™m interested in engineering, programming, 3D printing, and hopefully getting a job soon.
- My current languages of interest are Python and C++. I've been using Python for a while now but I still have lots I want to learn with it.
C++ is newer to me but being the fourth language I've worked with now I think I'm picking up on it quickly.
- Iâ€™m currently looking for an entry level job in the aerospace industry. My degree is in aerospace engineering, but most of my programming eduction has come from     my own interest. I also do a fair amount of 3D printing, so additive manufacturing work is on my radar too.
